    <h1>There are many opportunities to build wealth besides a job, for example trusts and Cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency market is a broad market where you can choose in which crypto cryptocurrency you'd like to invest in. It is like the stock market but not used as widely. The cryptocurrency-market is often regarded as a more risky alternative to make extra income.  A less risky alternative to Cryptocurrencies is the stock market. It still allowes you to buy shares in a company but the market shifts are often not as sudden.</h1>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <h3>Trusts</h3>
    <p>A trust is a legal arrangement where a trustee manages assets for a beneficiary. Trusts are commonly used in estate planning to manage wealth and reduce tax liabilities.</p>

    <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital assets using blockchain technology for secure transactions. They operate outside traditional financial systems, offering investment opportunities but involving significant risks due to sudden market shifts.</p>

    <h3>Stock Market</h3>
    <p>The stock market works by buying and selling shares of publicly traded companies. It enables investors to grow wealth through dividends and stock appreciation.</p>
